# GUYS Casino Game - Readme

## Overview
This console application, named "GUYS," is inspired by the exercises in Chapter 3 of the Head First C# book, focusing on classes. The program simulates a simple casino game where a player interacts with the `Guy` class to place bets and try their luck against the odds.

## Learning Objectives
Developing this application provides an opportunity to strengthen skills related to:

1. **Class Implementation:** The `Guy` class represents an entity with properties like `Name` and `Cash` and methods like `WriteMyInfo`, `GiveCash`, and `ReceiveCash`. Understanding how to encapsulate data and behavior within a class is a key learning objective.

2. **User Interaction:** The application engages the user in a casino-like scenario, prompting them to place bets and simulating wins or losses based on random odds. This reinforces skills related to user input, validation, and feedback.

3. **Randomization:** The use of the `Random` class and probability (odds) introduces randomness into the application, showcasing how to incorporate chance and unpredictability into game logic.

4. **Error Handling:** The application includes basic error handling, ensuring that the user provides a valid numerical input for betting.

## Getting Started
To run the application:

1. Copy and paste the provided code into your preferred C# development environment.
2. Ensure you have the `GuysConsoleApp` namespace available or modify the code accordingly.
3. Run the application and follow the prompts to observe the player's interactions in the casino.

## Key Components
- **Guy Class:** Represents an individual with a name and cash. Methods like `WriteMyInfo`, `GiveCash`, and `ReceiveCash` encapsulate the behavior of a person in the casino scenario.

## Casino Simulation
The game simulates a casino scenario with a player (`The player`) starting with $100 cash. The odds of winning are set to 75%. The player continues to place bets until their cash runs out.

## Reflection
As you engage with this exercise, consider the following aspects:

- **Class Design:** Evaluate the design of the `Guy` class. Assess whether it effectively encapsulates the required properties and behaviors.

- **User Interaction:** Explore how the application interacts with the user during the betting process. Consider ways to enhance the user experience.

- **Randomization:** Reflect on the use of randomness in the game. Consider how this element adds excitement and variability to the casino experience.

By reflecting on these aspects, you can further refine your understanding of class design, user interaction, and incorporating randomness into applications. This exercise provides a practical way to reinforce these concepts through hands-on coding and experimentation.
